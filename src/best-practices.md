# Best practices

* VFPL file names are written in `PascalCase` with the extension `.vfpl`
* Functions are in `snake_case`
* Variables are also in `snake_case`
* Mutable variables start with an `Uppercase` letter
* Indentation is done with 4 spaces
* Subexpressions are wrapped in parentheses `add 6 to (multiply 5 with 7)`
* `True` and `False` are referenced in uppercase
* Types (expect the null values) are `Uppercase`
